# Health Metrics Prediction

This project predicts systolic blood pressure using simple health metrics such as age, BMI, and exercise frequency.  
We use the BRFSS Indicators dataset and implement Linear Regression and SGDRegressor models.

## Installation
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```zsh
python main.py
```
# Results

* Test MSE: ~597

* Important features: Age, BMI, Exercise Frequency

* Scatter plots and feature importance charts are generated

# Future Improvements

* Add more health-related features (smoking, sleep, alcohol)

* Experiment with advanced regression models

* Better feature engineering

* change!
